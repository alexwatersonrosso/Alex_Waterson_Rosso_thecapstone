This is my final capstone project. I am submitting this for my MIT certificate in MERN. I made this capstone project following the udemy tutorial Next.js - Build Full Stack Apps with Next.js using Redux. This app is incredibly fast and because it uses next.js. Test it out for yourself. This app works on all devices. Although I followed a udemy tutorial I still had to type and debug errors to get this project running. Also, if you try to just copy exactly what he types you won't catch his syntax errors and spelling errors. To solve those issues you do have to develop a understanding of Redux, Next, React, Debugging, Stripe and Paths and Routing.
